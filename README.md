# The official group of the Application "Tender"

## Contains both mobile and backend applications for "Tender" as well as related diagrams and other utilities.

### "Tender" is GrubFlow's cross-platform mobile application designed to help group(s) of users determine which foods they're going to choose on a given day. 

#### "Tender" tracks user's 'Grub Taste' across restaurants and recipes, facilitating collaboration on what meals to select by learning individual and group(s) preferences over time. "Tender" streamlines the decision-making process by offering voting mechanisms such as 'Daily Grub', and allowing for modifications on 'Your Grub'. Additionally, "Tender" offers a group leaderboard, displaying rankings ('Grub Score') you and your 'Grubmates' have given to foods, effectively agreeing on a meal. This is a group's 'Grub Taste' portfolio. A user's 'Grub Taste' is a list of ratings, and likes/dislikes for foods. These foods can be local restaurants or recipes the user chooses to list with, allowing users to share 'Grub' recipes amongst 'Grubmates'. Users can create multiple groups, allowing for easy access to diverse group's 'Grub Taste' portfolios.
